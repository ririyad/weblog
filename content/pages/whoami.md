#### Why Writing Blog :question:
When you read something, you simply convince yourself that you understand it properly. But when you write down the same thing, you have to prove that you understand it properly by putting it into meaningful sentences.<br>
In that way, writing has helped me put together my knowledge in a systematic manner.

This site is primarily focused on self-improvement through understanding and better thinking. I keep notes on everything I learn from books, articles, speeches, and more, and publish it here. One other motivation was to document my learning so that somebody else can take benefit from it.

Now go ahead, and read some of the stuff form **[blog posts](/posts)** and add me to your [RSS](/index.xml) reader. :smiley: <br>
If you wanted to know what I'm up to now,  you can visit the **[now page](/pages/now)**.
