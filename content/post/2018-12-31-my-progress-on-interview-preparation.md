title: "My Progress on Interview Preparation"
---
I started my [interview preparation](https://rimonmostafiz.com/post/the-game-is-on) 2 months ago(November, 2018), I start to read [K&R C Programming Book](https://rimonmostafiz.com/post/taking-a-step-back-starting-with-c).<br>
Around mid of December suddenly I discover that I'm reading a go programming language book and spring related articles. which was obviously not the plan.

So what was the problem?

 - I want to learn lots of things
 - I've too many interests in new technology
 - I've very short attention span
 - There are so many destruction out there for me

I was playing Badminton after office, I was on a vacation for a week with family and was busy on a project for a week, little did I noticed that I'm not continuing my study plan properly.

After noticing that I completed C programming Book and started reading C++ Primer Plus Book. But things are not going well and I'm not happy with my progress so far.

### What Next
After wasting this 2 months I learned that I need to study little differently.<br>
Following the [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) from top to bottom will take huge time, which I don't have right now. I have a limited time to study and take preparation as I have a full time job and family responsibility. I can't waste my time in not so important things.

I actually don't need to learn all of it from the scratch, as I'm already familiar with many of the topics. So I'm going to prioritize things I need to learn in this limited time period.

I will not read any language related book right now as I am quite comfortable with C/C++ and Java. I can code algorithms after reading them. So right now reading a language book is not going to help me.
Rather I will jump straight on more important topics for interview.
