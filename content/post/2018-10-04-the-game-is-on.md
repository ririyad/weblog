title: The Game Is On
---
2-3 months ago, I was surfing the web and found an article titled  [Why I studied full-time for 8 months for a Google interview](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13).

The writer of this is [John Washam](https://startupnextdoor.com/about/), who is a self-taught web developer with 15 years of experience. While he was seeking a career change he wanted to join Google as Software Engineer. But he doesn't have any computer science degree and doesn't have the knowledge that large companies expect from candidates.

In 2016, He somehow got a copy of Googleâ€™s coaching notes that Google provides to interview candidates. That became the basis of his study plan. He turned the topics on the notes into an outline and started filling in the topics with YouTube videos of lectures from MIT and UC Berkeley. The list started to grow.

He published a GitHub repository named
[Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) with his study material and which now has **69,251** stars.

After going through his computer science study plan which took months to get through, and more months of practicing for the whiteboard interview. He finally made it!!<br>
**He got a job as Software Development Engineer at Amazon.com.** :tada:

I read all his article in [medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@googleyasheck) and his [blog post's](https://startupnextdoor.com/) in order to understand and follow his journey. It took him months of non-stop effort, sacrifice and lots of practice.

##### I am very much inspired by his story. I decided to give it a try.

So I will follow in his footsteps, I will cover this syllabus and I will start from the beginning. <br>
I already know some of the algorithm and data structure as I studied some in university. Also, I had learned some of those for programming contests. <br>

I want to upgrade my skills, not just a bit, but an order of magnitude - enough to be hired at a large tech company like Google or Amazon. It's time for me to level up. :boom: **I am taking it as a challenge**. I want to work where engineers are building the future of wondrous things.

I'm starting from today, so the game is on! :rocket:
