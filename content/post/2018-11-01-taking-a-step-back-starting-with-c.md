title: "Taking a Step Back: Starting With C"

I'm going back in time, Sometimes taking a step back can move you forward.

At my 2nd trimester at university(February, 2012) I took SPL(Structured Programming Language) course. Where I first learned C programming.

After that from 2013 to 2015 I wrote a fair number of C code. I used to participate programming contests and I solved problems in different online judge. Now-a-days I don't write C codes. Its been almost 2 year I'm working in Java. But for Software Engineering interview my choice is C/C++ (also will practice coding in Java).

I'll be reading the classic book: [The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) by Kernighan & Ritchie.<br>
I bought a hard copy and also got a kindle edition. I will take notes and will practice some exercise.

### But Why C Now?
I want to learn C as a basis for C++, because truly speaking I think I don't know C++ deeply<br>
Okay, I know how to use STL. I used them in programming contests, but I'm not comfortable with OOP with C++. I don't know much of the language feature of C++ because I never read a book of C++ or worked with it on some big project. I only learned as much as I need to solve programming contest problems. But I want to learn C++, and learn it well. You may say, This C book is the little warm-up for my C++ mastery challenge.

You see, I have a long way to go. So if you're starting from zero, you can follow along with me.

Let's do this thing!
