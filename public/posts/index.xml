      <description>Node Version Manager (NVM) is a simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions.
Install NVM To install or update nvm, you can use the install script using cURL or Wget
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash #or $ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash  The script clones the nvm repository to ~/.nvm and adds the source line to your profile (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc,~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc).
&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;pl-k&amp;quot;&amp;gt;export&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; NVM_DIR=&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;pl-s&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;pl-pds&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;pl-smi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;$HOME&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;/.</description>

      <description>In the previous post of my spring-diary, I wrote about how can we implicitly wire beans automatically in Spring container. In my previous post I created a new maven project and started writing code so that we can understand the topics more clearly. In this post, I am documenting my learning of how we can wire bean using Explicit Java Configuration. I will work on the same project I have created earlier.</description>

      <description>As we previously discussed that the Spring container is responsible for creating the beans in your application and coordinating the relationship between those objects vi DI. The act of creating these associations between application objects in the essence of dependency injection(DI) and is commonly referred to as wiring.
Different Types of Bean Wiring Spring Offers three primary wiring mechanism
 An explicit configuration in XML
 An explicit configuration in Java</description>

      <description>In the last post of Spring Diary, we discussed the basics of spring IoC Container and we saw a high-level view of how Spring Container works.
In this post, we will learn about how can we Instantiate a Spring IoC container(using ApplicaitonContext Interface) and configure that container using configuration metadata.
Spring IoC container consumes a form of _configuration metadata. _This configuration metadata represents how you as an application developer tell the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and assemble the objects in your application.</description>

      <description>Overview There is some confusion these days over the meaning of inversion of control due to the rise of _IoC containers. _An IoC container is a common characteristic of frameworks that implement Inversion of Control (IoC).
Some people confuse the general principle here with the specific styles of inversion of control (such as dependency injection) that these containers use. It is a process whereby objects define their dependencies, that is, the other objects they work with, only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method.</description>

      <description>Inversion of control (IoC) In software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a design principle. It is used to invert different kinds of controls. More Specifically invert the control of your custom written program or objects of a program is transferred to a container or framework.
In traditional programming, our custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.</description>

      <description>HttpServletResponse The HttpServletResponse interface extends ServletResponse and provides access to the HTTP protocol-specific properties of a response.
You can use the response object to do things such as
 Set response headers
 Write to the response body
 Redirect the request
 Set the HTTP status code
 Send cookies back to the client.
  Writing to Response Body The most common thing you’ll do with a response object is written content to the response body.</description>

      <description>HTTPServletRequest The HServletRequestttp interface is an extension of ServletRequest that provides additional HTTP protocol-specific information about a received request. It specifies dozens of methods that you can use to obtain details about an HTTP request. It also permits you to set request attributes (different from request parameters).
Request Param Request parameters come in two different forms:
 Query parameters (also called URI parameters)
 An application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data encoded request body(typically called post variables or form variables).</description>

First, let&amp;rsquo;s create a maven project and add the dependency. As a prerequisite, JDK 8 will be needed. If you are using Linux based operating system then I have written a post on how to install and manage different versions of JDK in your system. You can visit this post if JDK 8 is not installed on your system.</description>

      <description>Directory Structure and WAR Files Standard Java EE web applications are deployed as WAR files or “exploded” (unarchived) web application directories. All Java EE web application servers support WAR file application archives. Whether archived or exploded, the directory structure convention, as shown in Figure is the same.
 This structure contains classes and other application resources, the class files live in /WEB-INF/classes. The WEB-INF directory stores informational and instructional files that Java EE web application servers use to determine how to deploy and run the application.</description>

      <description>Basic Web Application Structure A lot of components go into making a Java EE application.
 Application Code and Third Party Libraries it depends on
 Deployment Descriptor, which includes instructions for deploying and starting the application
 ClassLoders which is responsible for isolating your application form other web applications on the same server
 Finally the WAR and EAR files
  Servlets, Filters, Listeners, and JSPs  Servlets are a key component of any Java EE applications.</description>

      <description>Spring MVC Java Configuration Hi All, This _should_ be the first in a series of &amp;ldquo;Rimon learns Spring&amp;rdquo; type blog posts I plan on writing as I learn bits of Spring. I am just documenting my learnings, not advising others based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
Spring traditionally supports two types of configurations:
 XML based configuration
 Annotation-based configuration
  This post is about a bare minimum annotation-based configuration of spring MVC.</description>

      <description>What is SDKMAN? [SDKMAN!](http://sdkman.io/index.html) is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix based systems. It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. Its also open source. You can see the codes form [SDKMAN&#39;s github repository](https://github.com/sdkman). As a developer its very common that you work on multiple projects which use different JDK version. Obviously, you can use update-alternatives to manage multiple JDK libraries on the same system to select which one you want to use as the main one.</description>

Objective for this project is to make an obstacle sensor which will detect some object in front of it and send some signal.
The operation of the project is simple. When we approach an object sensor LEDs light up according to the distance of the object. The green LED switches on if you are away, yellow if in the middle distance and red if it is close. The sensing distances LEDs are programmable, if we want to change we can just change the source code of the project.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement:
UVa 10311 - Goldbach and Euler
We can express the problem statement like: Given an integer N (0 &amp;lt; N ≤ 108).
we have to find(if exists) two number P1 and P2 where,
 P1 and P2 both prime
 P1 + P2 = n
 P1 &amp;lt; P2
 P2 - P1 is minimized
  Solution Idea:
First of all we need to find prime numbers between [0:108].</description>

      <description>Problem Statement:
UVa 406 – Prime Cuts
Before beginning I want to say the problem description seems quite awkward to me, for me it took a time to understand what is actually asked by the problem. but when I found out its very easy to code.
** Solution Idea:**
First of all use Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate primes between 1000. You will be given two numbers N and C, then you need to make a list of primes between 1 to N(inclusive).</description>

      <description>Say we want to find all prime numbers up to an integer N where N is 108. If we write a regular implementation of Sieve Of Eratosthenes using a bool array for each integer in the range [1:N] then we could end up using N bytes of memory, which would roughly be 95 MB which is a huge memory.
 Lets see how can we reduce the memory, the main idea here is we can store a Boolean value in a single bit, so we can store 8 Boolean values in a single byte.</description>

if g = gcd(a, b), then g divides both a and b when at least one of them is non zero.
when gcd(a, b) == 1 then we said a and b is co-prime or relatively prime numbers.
