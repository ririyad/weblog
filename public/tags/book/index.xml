      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going back in time, Sometimes taking a step back can move you forward.
At my 2nd trimester at university I took SPL(Structured Programming Language) course. Where I first learned C programming and it was spring of 2012.
After that from 2013 to 2015 I wrote a fair number of C code. I used to participate programming contests and I solved problems in different online judge. Now-a-days I don&amp;rsquo;t write C codes.</description>
