      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going back in time, Sometimes taking a step back can move you forward.
At my 2nd trimester at university I took SPL(Structured Programming Language) course. Where I first learned C programming and it was spring of 2012.
After that from 2013 to 2015 I wrote a fair number of C code. I used to participate programming contests and I solved problems in different online judge. Now-a-days I don&amp;rsquo;t write C codes.</description>

      <description>2-3 months ago, I was surfing the web and found an article titled Why I studied full-time for 8 months for a Google interview.
The writer of this is John Washman, who is a self-taught web developer with 15 years of experience. While he was seeking a career change he wanted to join Google as Software Engineer. But he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any computer science degree and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the knowledge that large companies expect from candidates.</description>
