      <description>HttpServletResponse The HttpServletResponse interface extends ServletResponse and provides access to the HTTP protocol-specific properties of a response.
You can use the response object to do things such as
 Set response headers
 Write to the response body
 Redirect the request
 Set the HTTP status code
 Send cookies back to the client.
  Writing to Response Body The most common thing you’ll do with a response object is written content to the response body.</description>

First, let&amp;rsquo;s create a maven project and add the dependency. As a prerequisite, JDK 8 will be needed. If you are using Linux based operating system then I have written a post on how to install and manage different versions of JDK in your system.

      <description>Basic Web Application Structure A lot of components go into making a Java EE application.
 Application Code and Third Party Libraries it depends on
 Deployment Descriptor, which includes instructions for deploying and starting the application
 ClassLoders which is responsible for isolating your application form other web applications on the same server
 Finally the WAR and EAR files
  Servlets, Filters, Listeners, and JSPs  Servlets are a key component of any Java EE applications.</description>

      <description>Spring MVC Java Configuration Hi All, This _should_ be the first in a series of &amp;ldquo;Rimon learns Spring&amp;rdquo; type blog posts I plan on writing as I learn bits of Spring. I am just documenting my learnings, not advising others based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
Spring traditionally supports two types of configurations:
 XML based configuration
 Annotation-based configuration
  This post is about a bare minimum annotation-based configuration of spring MVC.</description>
