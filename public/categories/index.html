      Say we want to find all prime numbers up to an integer N where N is 108. If we write a regular implementation of Sieve Of Eratosthenes using a bool array for each integer in the range [1:N] then we could end up using N bytes of memory, which would roughly be 95 MB which is a huge memory.
 Lets see how can we reduce the memory, the main idea here is we can store a Boolean value in a single bit, so we can store 8 Boolean values in a single byte.

Objective for this project is to make an obstacle sensor which will detect some object in front of it and send some signal.
The operation of the project is simple. When we approach an object sensor LEDs light up according to the distance of the object. The green LED switches on if you are away, yellow if in the middle distance and red if it is close. The sensing distances LEDs are programmable, if we want to change we can just change the source code of the project.

 This structure contains classes and other application resources, the class files live in /WEB-INF/classes. The WEB-INF directory stores informational and instructional files that Java EE web application servers use to determine how to deploy and run the application.

It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. Its also open source. You can see the codes form [SDKMAN's github repository](https://github.com/sdkman). As a developer its very common that you work on multiple projects which use different JDK version. Obviously, you can use update-alternatives to manage multiple JDK libraries on the same system to select which one you want to use as the main one.

      Overview There is some confusion these days over the meaning of inversion of control due to the rise of _IoC containers. _An IoC container is a common characteristic of frameworks that implement Inversion of Control (IoC).
Some people confuse the general principle here with the specific styles of inversion of control (such as dependency injection) that these containers use. It is a process whereby objects define their dependencies, that is, the other objects they work with, only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method.

      Inversion of control (IoC) In software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a design principle. It is used to invert different kinds of controls. More Specifically invert the control of your custom written program or objects of a program is transferred to a container or framework.
In traditional programming, our custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.

      In the last post of Spring Diary, we discussed the basics of spring IoC Container and we saw a high-level view of how Spring Container works.
In this post, we will learn about how can we Instantiate a Spring IoC container(using ApplicaitonContext Interface) and configure that container using configuration metadata.
Spring IoC container consumes a form of _configuration metadata. _This configuration metadata represents how you as an application developer tell the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and assemble the objects in your application.

Spring traditionally supports two types of configurations:
 XML based configuration
 Annotation-based configuration

      Directory Structure and WAR Files Standard Java EE web applications are deployed as WAR files or “exploded” (unarchived) web application directories. All Java EE web application servers support WAR file application archives. Whether archived or exploded, the directory structure convention, as shown in Figure is the same.
 This structure contains classes and other application resources, the class files live in /WEB-INF/classes. The WEB-INF directory stores informational and instructional files that Java EE web application servers use to determine how to deploy and run the application.

      Basic Web Application Structure A lot of components go into making a Java EE application.
 Application Code and Third Party Libraries it depends on
 Deployment Descriptor, which includes instructions for deploying and starting the application
 ClassLoders which is responsible for isolating your application form other web applications on the same server
 Finally the WAR and EAR files
  Servlets, Filters, Listeners, and JSPs  Servlets are a key component of any Java EE applications.
