      <description>HttpServletResponse The HttpServletResponse interface extends ServletResponse and provides access to the HTTP protocol-specific properties of a response.
You can use the response object to do things such as
 Set response headers
 Write to the response body
 Redirect the request
 Set the HTTP status code
 Send cookies back to the client.
  Writing to Response Body The most common thing you’ll do with a response object is written content to the response body.</description>

      <description>HTTPServletRequest The HServletRequestttp interface is an extension of ServletRequest that provides additional HTTP protocol-specific information about a received request. It specifies dozens of methods that you can use to obtain details about an HTTP request. It also permits you to set request attributes (different from request parameters).
Request Param Request parameters come in two different forms:
 Query parameters (also called URI parameters)
 An application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data encoded request body(typically called post variables or form variables).</description>

First, let&amp;rsquo;s create a maven project and add the dependency. As a prerequisite, JDK 8 will be needed. If you are using Linux based operating system then I have written a post on how to install and manage different versions of JDK in your system. You can visit this post if JDK 8 is not installed on your system.</description>

      <description>Directory Structure and WAR Files Standard Java EE web applications are deployed as WAR files or “exploded” (unarchived) web application directories. All Java EE web application servers support WAR file application archives. Whether archived or exploded, the directory structure convention, as shown in Figure is the same.
 This structure contains classes and other application resources, the class files live in /WEB-INF/classes. The WEB-INF directory stores informational and instructional files that Java EE web application servers use to determine how to deploy and run the application.</description>

      <description>Basic Web Application Structure A lot of components go into making a Java EE application.
 Application Code and Third Party Libraries it depends on
 Deployment Descriptor, which includes instructions for deploying and starting the application
 ClassLoders which is responsible for isolating your application form other web applications on the same server
 Finally the WAR and EAR files
  Servlets, Filters, Listeners, and JSPs  Servlets are a key component of any Java EE applications.</description>

      <description>How to set up alias in Linux Every time I need to see different projects logs from application servers logs folder from different terminal window, I have to go to Weblogic&amp;rsquo;s logs folder and then open the log file using less or tail -f project-name.log 
cd /home/rimonmostafiz/Applications/Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains/base_domain/logs/ less project-name.log or tail -f project-name.log  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write this long string Everytime, Wouldn’t it be easier to just type something like the following?</description>

      <description>Spring MVC Java Configuration Hi All, This _should_ be the first in a series of &amp;ldquo;Rimon learns Spring&amp;rdquo; type blog posts I plan on writing as I learn bits of Spring. I am just documenting my learnings, not advising others based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
Spring traditionally supports two types of configurations:
 XML based configuration
 Annotation-based configuration
  This post is about a bare minimum annotation-based configuration of spring MVC.</description>

      <description>What is SDKMAN? [SDKMAN!](http://sdkman.io/index.html) is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix based systems. It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. Its also open source. You can see the codes form [SDKMAN&#39;s github repository](https://github.com/sdkman). As a developer its very common that you work on multiple projects which use different JDK version. Obviously, you can use update-alternatives to manage multiple JDK libraries on the same system to select which one you want to use as the main one.</description>

At the time of writing this post, I download version is sqldeveloper-17.2.0.188.1159-no-jre.zip. _You will also need Java to run Oracle SQL developer.
After download, I moved the download file to /home/rimonmostafiz/Applications (you can choose any other location you prefer).

      <description>Since there is no official Google Drive client for Ubuntu or Linux Mint but if you need to use it then there is an unofficial client called Grive2. Grive is a Google Drive client for GNU/Linux systems. It allows the synchronization of all your files on the cloud with a directory of your choice and the upload of new files to Google Drive.
Those of you used Google Drive client on Windows or Mac, Grive2 will do the same for you in Ubuntu or Linux Mint.</description>
